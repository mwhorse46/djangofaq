# GitHub Theming Example

This repo is intended to help give an example of the power of theming in Semantic UI. 

#### Example Layouts

* [GitHub Modern Layout](http://semantic-org.github.io/example-github/index.html)
* [GitHub Classic Layout](http://semantic-org.github.io/example-github/index-classic.html)

### About 

* GitHub's repo homepage is redone using Semantic UI and a packaged [GitHub Theme](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/example-github/tree/master/semantic/src/themes/github)
* To view how this page would look using other themes, simply clone the repo and adjust component's themes in [theme.config](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/example-github/blob/master/semantic/src/theme.config)
* This is also intended to help provide insight into when CSS changes should be included in theme `.overrides` or in custom [layout specific css](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/example-github/blob/master/css/layouts/home.css)
* For example, check out how [theming variables](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/example-github/blob/master/semantic/src/themes/github/collections/menu.variables#L29) and [css overrides](https://github.com/Semantic-Org/example-github/blob/master/semantic/src/themes/github/collections/menu.overrides) create GitHub's unique style of `tabular menu`.
